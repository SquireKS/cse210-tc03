I live in Tokyo, Japan. I am currently enrolled at university working towards
my Applied Technology BS. Originally I chose to study technology because as a 
foreigner living in Japan there are not a lot of options available for work 
here. Once I started taking classes however I realized I was actually having a
 lot of fun! I discovered something that I was actually passionate about and I
  can't wait to see what the future holds!
