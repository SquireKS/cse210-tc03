Hi everyone, My name is Gerald Quispe (45) I am from Lima, Perú. I love music and play the Piano, I met my wife in a stake choir, I was playing the piano, and my wife was singing, so now we have three kids and 11 years of marriage. I like technology and all the stuff that is related to science and engineering. My favorite place is Machu Picchu, Cuzco, it is an archaeological site, I had the opportunity to hike the "Waynapicchu" which is the tallest mountain in the reserve, it is a beautiful place but also I was amazed how the Incas can build an entire city made of granite stone in the top of the mountains.

I am from Ica, a province at the south of Lima, but I live in Lima for 20 years.
