Kameron Squire

I live in Tokyo, Japan. I am currently enrolled at university working towards
my Applied Technology BS. Originally I chose to study technology because as a 
foreigner living in Japan there are not a lot of options available for work 
here. Once I started taking classes however I realized I was actually having a
 lot of fun! I discovered something that I was actually passionate about and I
  can't wait to see what the future holds!

Hi everyone, My name is Gerald Quispe (45) I am from Lima, Perú. I love music and play the Piano, I met my wife in a stake choir, I was playing the piano, and my wife was singing, so now we have three kids and 11 years of marriage. I like technology and all the stuff that is related to science and engineering. My favorite place is Machu Picchu, Cuzco, it is an archaeological site, I had the opportunity to hike the "Waynapicchu" which is the tallest mountain in the reserve, it is a beautiful place but also I was amazed how the Incas can build an entire city made of granite stone in the top of the mountains.

I am from Ica, a province at the south of Lima, but I live in Lima for 20 years.

Thank you for the nice bio Gerald!
It's nice to get to to know you even a bit more :)

Hey!
I'm Bogdan and like bananas very much!
I'm trying to have no processed sugars in my nutrition so that's why all the sweet fruits are my favorite!!
